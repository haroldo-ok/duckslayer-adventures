This game is called "Duckslayer Adventures".

It is a tribute to an Atari 2600 game named 'Adventure'.
In it, you control the intrepid Knight of the Square Table, Sir Jelly, the gelatinous cube.
His mission is to retrieve the Holy Chalice of Yendor that's stored inside the black castle, guarded by two fearsome Duck Dragons, and bring it back to the yellow castle.
